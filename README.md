# roblox-mazes

the maze is published here; https://www.roblox.com/games/9397399366/demo-maze-1

this is about 3/4 hours of me trying to crucnh out a basic depth-first maze generator

it's not very gracefully written ... but ... (until last week) i hadn't used Lua in over 15 years so i feel smug that i got it together in about the same time my bread machine took to run

going forward ... i dunno; mojo integration and/or only being able to "see" the cell you're on and a few more?

... more mazes in parallel?
